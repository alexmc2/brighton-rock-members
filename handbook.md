1. International Co-operative Principles
   (As adopted by the 1966 congress of the International Co-operative Alliance)

Open, voluntary membership

Membership of a Co-operative society should be voluntary and available without artificial restriction or any social, political or religious discrimination, to all persons who can make use of its services and are willing to accept the responsibilities of membership.

Democratic control – one member, one vote

Co-operative societies are democratic organisations. Their affairs should be administered by persons elected or appointed in a manner agreed by the members and accountable to them. Members of primary societies should enjoy equal rights of voting (one member, one vote) and participation in decisions affecting their societies. In other than primary societies, the administration should be conducted on a democratic basis in a suitable form.

Limited return on investment

Share capital should only receive a strictly limited rate of investment.

Not-for-profit operation

The economic results arising out of the operation of a society belong to the members of that society and should be distributed in such a manner as would avoid one member gaining at the expense of others. This may be done by decision of the members as follows:
a) by provision for development of the business of the Co-operative
b) b) by provision of common services
c) by distribution among its members in proportion to their transactions with the society.

Continuing education

All co-operatives should make provision for the education of their members, officers and employees and of the general public, in principles and techniques of Co-operation, both economic and democratic.

Co-operation among Co-operatives

All Co-operative organisations, in order to best serve the interest of their members and their communities should actively co-operate in every practical way with other co-operatives at local, national and international levels.

Brighton Rock Housing Co-operative – What we are / Role descriptions

What we are
Brighton Rock Housing Co-operative, based in Hove, is run in accordance with the International Co-operative Principles and aims to provide affordable short life housing to people living in a single household setting. We are managing agents for Places for People Housing a housing company registered for social housing. This means that instead of us having the head lease directly with the property owner, Places for People has the head lease and rents the houses at a cheap rate in return for which we perform some of the managerial duties.

What is short-life?
Short life is a term which means a property is licensed/leased to a co-op or a housing association for a set period of time, from 6 month to 10 years. Short-life properties are usually houses that cannot be used otherwise – e.g. they cannot be repaired up to standard or are awaiting demolition. The three properties of Brighton Rock are short-life with 10-year leases from 1997, (recently renewed for another 10 years assured and further 15 years potential). At present we have no plans for expansion.

History
Brighton Rock was started by a group of students in 1986, who were looking to combine shared housing, affordable rents, the security of ongoing housing and a level of self-management not offered by private sector accommodation.

Two empty properties where identified on Kingsway, Hove, negotiations with East Sussex County council were entered into. Grant money was obtained to do work on the houses and soon Brighton Rock members moved in under an agreement with Brighton Housing Trust. A third property was later vacated by its Council tenants and became part of the co-op.

Structure
Brighton Rock holds monthly general meetings, where decisions are made and the day-to-day running of the co-op is attended to . One person chairs the meeting, and another takes minutes. Minutes are circulated to the members and the minute’s record is available for inspection through the Secretary.

Every Co-op member fills one of the following positions:

    • Secretary (and depute): collects and collates all correspondence, convenes meetings, circulates minutes, convenes the Annual General Meeting, and acts as first point of contact for the Co-op.
    • Treasurer (and depute): looks after the finances of the co-op (payments, accounts, annual returns as well as advise on the budgets.
    • Rent officer (and depute): ensures prompt payment of rent and follows up late payments with appropriate action.
    • Maintenance officer (and deputy) carries out the maintenance policy as summarised later chapter of this handbook.
    • Garden officer: oversees work required in the garden.
    • Shop keeper: takes internal shop orders and keeps shop accounts.
    • Allocations officer: oversees and organises the allocation process when vacancies arise within the co-op.
    • Maintaining link to other co-op’s officers, attending monthly meetings.

Development and Outreach role:

    1. Developing and strengthening local links with our co-operative and other co-operatives. 


    • Exchanging ideas/implementation of ideas, policy, outreach, etc.
    • Arranging meetups/putting events together with other co-operatives.
    • Working with other co-operatives for local initiatives/awareness drives.
    • Providing a presence in our local community with active engagement that promotes the concept of co-operatives as a form of mutual aid. 
    • Feeding back news and requests from these integrations with our co-op.
    • Developing our newsfeed, communications and social engagement (social media and otherwise).


    2. Observing and taking in positive ideas from these engagements, putting them to the democratic consideration of our members for implementation in our own co-op. 


    • Democratic discussion of new ideas that still adhere to the current best practices of Brighton Rock, and emphasising principles of equality, tolerance and engagement, for the benefit of all members no matter their background or ability.

Garden Role:

The garden is a large area that requires a team effort. The garden role relies on all members of the co-op to chip in and help contribute to the space. The garden officer has the following job as a priority. It is the garden officer's responsibility to encourage, engage and organise the rest of the members with garden tasks.

    1. Garden:

    • Weeding
    • Watering
    • Maintaining the compost
    • Germinating seeds
    • Communicating with the rest of the members about plans and ideas
    • Appropriately using the garden budget
    • Maintaining garden furniture / fire pit / outside shed / greenhouse



    2. Report back to the co-op each month in GM's

    3. Main report once a year at AGM including budget spending

Treasury Role:

The treasury role is shared between a Treasurer and a Deputy Treasurer. The treasury role can be broadly categorised into three main areas: monthly bookkeeping, preparing annual accounts and returns, and annual budgeting. One treasurer will also take on responsibility for paying expense claims. 1. Monthly Bookkeeping: The Treasurers are responsible for maintaining accurate financial records on a monthly basis. This involves:
• Obtaining the latest bank statement for the month and reconciling transactions with the co-op's records
• Entering income and expenditure amounts into the designated spreadsheet, allocating them to the appropriate categories
• Ensuring that the total for each category matches the corresponding amounts in the bank statement
• Preparing a monthly update email for co-op members, including the balance at the beginning and end of the month, total payments, and total income 2. Annual Budgeting: The Treasurers play a key role in preparing the annual budgets for the upcoming financial year, which is presented and voted on during the Annual General Meeting (AGM). This involves:
• Updating the budget spreadsheet with the actual income and expenditure amounts from the previous year
• Collaborating with co-op members to create multiple budget proposals based on anticipated expenses, new initiatives, and the co-op's financial sustainability
• Presenting the budget proposals at the AGM and guiding the discussion to ensure the selected budget aligns with the co-op's goals
• Updating the monthly reconciliation spreadsheet with the approved budget figures for the new financial year
• Throughout the year, the Treasurers monitor the co-op's financial position by comparing actual income and expenditure against the budgeted amounts and reporting any anomalies to the general meeting, ensuring the co-op remains financially stable. 3. Expense Claims and Payments: One of the Treasurers will take responsibility for making payments to co-op members who submit expense claims against the various budgets. When a co-op member makes an expense claim on their house budget, they must ensure that all other members of their house are copied (CC'd) into the email for full transparency. The Treasurer will then process the claim and make the payment to the respective co-op member.

    3. Summary of policies

This is an explanation and summary of some of the policies included in the handbook. These form the basis of how the co-op is run. Some of them use quite technical language – it is important that you understand them so if you are having any difficulties please ask another co-op member to explain them to you.

Equal opportunities policy

All co-ops, by law must have an equal opportunities policy. It affects everything the co-op does and nothing is allowed which contradicts it. It is especially important when allocating. The co-op is obliged to ensure that it is not just a paper policy but is considered and implemented in all its work. Individual members should familiarise themselves with this policy and ensure that both they and the co-op comply with it.

Confidentiality policy

This assures that confidential information about members is kept confidential. You should be aware of this policy when doing work on behalf of the co-op.

Membership policy

This sets down the criteria and guidelines for membership of the housing co-op.

Allocations policy

This explains how we allocate houses to members.

Attendance policy

This policy lays down guidelines for members on attending meetings. It contains clauses that allow someone’s membership of the co-op to be terminated if they fail to attend meetings. This was put in place to ensure that everybody takes part in running the co-op rather than all the responsibility falling on a few people.

Rent arrears policy

This lays down how rent arrears are dealt with and what the consequences of accumulating rent arrears may be. It also explains what the rent arrears officer’s role is.

Grievance policy

This lays down how the co-op deals with any disputes that arise between members, or between members and the co-op. It tries to ensure that everybody gets fair and equal treatment. The policy contains details of how we go about dealing with complaints and what to do if you have a complaint (in the first instance, you should write or talk to a co-op officer such as the treasurer or secretary).

Maintenance policy

This deals with repairs to co-op housing. It will become important to you when you are housed by the co-op. It tells you how to get repairs done and what your responsibilities are. It lays down guidelines for the maintenance officer. It also contains two sections which lay out what the different categories of repair are.

    4. Equal Opportunities Policy

Brighton Rock Housing Co-operative is committed to equal opportunities in all areas of its work, and to fair and equal treatment of everyone who applies to it for membership and potential housing. The Co-op does not discriminate against anyone on any such grounds as age, race, sexuality or gender. The Co-op does not give priority to anyone who is related to Co-op members.
Brighton Rock housing co-operative actively encourages difference and diversity amongst its members. This is achievable only by recognition of what constitutes difference and the sources of oppression and discrimination. Therefore:-

Brighton Rock housing co-operative will not accept
Brighton Rock will not discriminate on the basis of
And will not discriminate against people with/who are
Ableism
Ability
Differently abled
Ageism
Belief
LGBTQI
Assumptions about class background
Disability
Ex-offenders
Bigotry (defined as religious)
Ethnicity
Mental health
Genderism
Gender
Older people/Younger People
Heterosexism
Individuals’ communication strength or weakness
Identifying as transgendered
Homophobia
Ethnicity
Women/Men
Racism
Sex
Identifying as queer
Sexism
Sexuality
Differing Ethnicities  
Transphobia
Neurodiversity

This list is not exhaustive. These lists come out of a belief that power is exerted to maintain inequality in society and that discrimination, oppression and repression arise out of fear and lack of education, a sense of disenfranchisement and lack of opportunity.
Core to the realization of this equal opportunities policy is the making of a personal commitment to think about, discuss and challenge discrimination, oppression and repression. Brighton Rock Housing Co-operative therefore endorses training and ongoing discussion.
If members are found to be in breach of this policy, such a breach will be dealt with in line with the current Mediation and Grievance policy.
Brighton Rock Housing co-operative is an eclectic group of individuals, at times it is necessary to balance the best interests of the co-op with the demands of equal opportunities.
If you feel the cooperative has unfairly discriminated against you, there is the opportunity to appeal cooperative decisions as laid out in the current allocation procedure.

    5. Allocations Policy

Any member or person in housing need can apply for housing vacancies within the co-op, by filling in the housing form.

Rooms are considered for single living people only.

Rooms are not considered to be a permanent place of residence for children.

As much as possible, a gender balance will be maintained in each household.

The Co-op generally regards applications by close friends and/or relatives to represent a potential conflict of interest. Where applicants are known to existing members, a declaration of interest by the member should be made to the Co-op as part of the allocations process. Where a close friend or relative does apply, the shortlisting group should decide whether it is appropriate to grant an interview and whether the member known to the applicant can participate further in the allocations process.
The following factors will be taken into account when applications are considered:

    • The applicant’s current housing situation, including state of repair, lack of basic amenities, suitability, overcrowding, and/or shared facilities, medical or mobility problems.
    • Domestic or other family problems, such as marriage or relationship breakdown, domestic violence, racial or sexual harassment or any housing problem which may affect the dependants of the applicant.
    • The applicant’s contact with the area, such as the need for ongoing care and support from family members or friends locally, family members in the area who may require specific support and care from the applicant.
    • The applicant’s ability to cope with his/her housing problems.
    • The length of time the applicant has had to endure poor housing conditions.
    • The applicant’s chances of obtaining re-housing by other means, e.g. the Borough Council. Another Co-op, Housing Association or by getting a mortgage.
    • Interest in and willingness to become involved in the Co-op.
    • The ability of the Co-op to provide suitable housing for the applicant.

Applicants will be dealt with using the following procedure:

    • All applications are considered. Any applicant who is in less severe housing need or for whom the Co-op cannot provide accommodation will be rejected at the stage.
    • Applicants will be required to attend an interview with existing Co-op members. Occupant’s preferences will be taken into account in the allocations procedure.
    • All detailed information will be considered and will provide the basis for the decision as to whether to accept or reject an applicant.
    • A single Co-operative household with a vacancy has the right to veto any applicant, with good reason. This veto overrides co-operative vote and is intended as a procedure of last resort. There will be a maximum of three vetoes per vacancy.
    • All applicants who have been turned down will receive a letter explaining the grounds on which their application was refused. They will also be given right to appeal.

The Co-op’s Equal Opportunities Policy will be at the heart of all processes and procedures.

All information submitted in support of an application will be treated in the strictest confidence.

Every effort will be made to adapt properties for people with disabilities.

The type of tenancy will be as Assured Tenancy.

    6. Membership policy

Confidentiality policy: All personal information given to Brighton Rock Housing Co-operative will be treated as confidential.

Membership policy: Being a member of a Co-op is different from being a tenant of the Co-op. Acting together, the members of the Co-op are their own landlord and must make the decisions that for other tenants are made by someone else. Membership comes with a different set of rights and responsibilities from those of a tenant and it is important that members are aware of them.

       Eligibility:

Those wishing to join Brighton Rock Housing Co-operative must be/have:
• 18 Years or over
• Have been accepted for membership at a General Meeting
• Prospective tenants of Brighton Rock Housing Co-operative
• Willing to abide by the rules and principals of the Co-op
• Paid for a £1 share certificate
• Fulfil any other criteria as may from time to time be decided by a general meeting

Members are entitled to certain rights and protections. These are contained within the confidentiality, equal opportunities, grievance, maintenance policies and sabbatical policies and summarised in the section entitled ‘Your Rights’ in the member’s handbook.

Members are subject to certain responsibilities. These are contained in the attendance, equal opportunities, rent arrears and maintenance policies and any tenancy agreement or subsequent agreement drawn up between tenants in shared housing or the member and the Co-op. These are summarised in the section entitled ‘Your Responsibilities’ in the member’s handbook.

           Termination of membership:

A member ceases to be a member if;
• They resign by writing to the Secretary or in person at a general meeting. In the case of full (housed) members 4 weeks’ notice is required to enable the property to be inspected for damages and habitability.
• The member has failed to meet the requirements for attendance as laid out in the attendance policy and are expelled or, in the case of associate members their membership will lapse
• They are expelled from membership as a result of the implementation of the grievance policy
• 28 days after the end of a member’s tenancy agreement, unless a new agreement is signed.
• The member dies

           Expulsion from membership:

A member may be expelled by a resolution carried by the votes of two-thirds of the membership at a general meeting only after the application of the grievance procedure has failed to secure a resolution.

Rights and Responsibilities of membership

   1. You should play and active role in the co-op according to your abilities and skills.
   2. You must make sure you understand what is meant by equal opportunities and that you uphold the co-op’s equal opportunity policy. This means that you must ensure that you treat everyone in the co-op fairly regardless of who they are or what your personal feelings towards them are. You must adhere to ground rules (respect others opinions, active listening etc.) and make sure that everybody gets a chance to speak, including the less confident. You must try and use non-offensive language.
   3. You are responsible for paying your own rent and bills, either individually or collectively with the other members of your household.
   4. If you are hosed by the co-op you must make sure that you keep the place where you are living in good condition. This means keeping communal areas, including stairways and garden tidy. You will be responsible for minor repairs and maintenance arising from everyday wear and tear. This means thinks like light bulbs, blown fuses, and internal decorations.
   5. You are responsible for keeping the co-op informed of any repairs that need doing. You should do this through the maintenance officer. This includes informing the co-op of any fault in repairs before the guarantee period runs out. You must provide access for the maintenance officer and/or contractors if reasonable notice is given.
   6. If emergency repairs are needed and the maintenance officer is unavailable then you must ensure they are carried out. You will be reimbursed for any cost when you provide receipts. For further details refer to the Maintenance section of this document.
   7. You will be held responsible for any repairs that result from your negligence or from deliberate acts of destruction by you or your guests.
   8. When you had your property back to the co-op you must ensure it is in a good state of repair and decoration.

Meeting Effectiveness

The purpose of a Brighton Rock General Meeting is to get through co-op business in a quick and efficient way. In addition, meetings make sure that everyone is informed about what is going on in the co-op. Everyone who is present at meetings, therefore, needs to contribute towards this aim.
Agenda items are taken in turn. During the discussion of each item, people should speak as briefly as possible and keep to the point being discussed bringing up:
New information that may help in reaching a decision;
Relevant information from the past experience of the co-op;
Or giving their viewpoint if it is different from what has already been said.
It is not helpful if people keep repeating viewpoints that have already been stressed.
If someone is speaking and you wish to say something, they should put up their hand so the Chair can invite them to speak in turn. Individuals should try to address everyone in the meeting equally and speak clearly so that everyone can hear the point.
As these are business meetings, it is useful if everyone keeps their personal grudges outside of the discussion – any co-op member may make a valid point or make a useful contribution. Sexist, racist or any other offensive remarks will not be tolerated.
If a member feels that the discussion is getting a bit heated, members can request either that the matter be deferred or a break be taken. Additionally, if a member feels annoyed by the opinions being given, he/she should make this known and explain why, suggest a deferral or take a break from the meeting. If the meeting is getting bogged down the following options are open:
Suggest a brainstorm1
Suggest a go-round2 that the group breaks up briefly into smaller discussion groups.
Deferral of item.
The chair should try to pick up on these feelings through the meeting and propose one of the above options.
Everyone should bring a means of recording to every meeting to make notes during discussions. This helps, for example, if you have a good idea to be given later in a discussion and avoids interruptions.

Chairing
The Chair is appointed at the start of the meeting. He/she should not try to speak too much at the meeting as they will need concentrate on keeping the meeting to the agenda, picking up the tone of the meeting and making sure everyone contributes. The Chair should keep an eye on new members. Should they show signs of bewilderment, the Chair should offer a brief explanation of the point being discussed. If the meeting is getting overheated or bogged down, the Chair should try to find out why and suggest one of the techniques described above to resolve this.
The Chair should state clearly when the meeting starts, check that the minute taker has recorded those present and asked for apologies and should then go through the agenda one item at a time.

Timekeeping
At the beginning of the meeting any member may suggest a ‘timed agenda’ (where each item is allocated a certain amount of time and a first speaker), or a guillotine (where there is a cut-off time by when any items not discussed get reported to the next meeting). In this case, a timekeeper should be agreed upon. When time is running short, the time-keeper should signal this to the meeting and a decision must be made as to whether to over-run the item’s allocated time (in the case of a timed agenda), whether a decision can be reached, or whether the matter should be deferred to the next meeting.

Minute Taking
The minute taker is responsible for ensuring that an accurate account of the meeting is kept. Additionally, for each agenda item it is useful to have some record of the main discussion points, as well as the final decision, so that people who are not present can get some idea of how the decision was reached. It is unnecessary, however, to write down the name of the speaker who made a particular point.
Recording the decision is absolutely essential to avoid further dispute. If a member is unclear as to what has been decided, the minute taker should be asked to remind the meeting. It is useful to the minute taker to read back the decision that has been recorded at the end of each item to ensure its accuracy.
At the beginning of the meeting the minute taker should record the names of those present, record any apologies, and make sure the matters arising from the previous minutes are discussed before going on to the next item. If the Chair misses any of these items, then the minute taker should make this known. The minute taker should make sure that the names of anyone arriving late are noted. However, if the individual arrives more than 30 minutes late then his/her attendance is not recorded.

Decision-making by Consensus
Decision making by consensus means that everyone agrees with the decision which is agreed without the need for a vote. As the discussion progresses on any particular agenda item the Chair should pick up whether a majority are in favour or against what is being proposed, or whether there is no clear majority. If the Chair feels a majority is evident then he/she should tell the meeting of this. However, if someone has a strong objection to the proposal members should express it. Consensus decision making is based on the idea that members are in favour of some decisions and not in favour of others. If members can accept a decision without necessarily agreeing with it, then members should not object to it. Basically, you win some, you lose some.
If a meeting appears to be equally divided on the item then the Chair should call for a go round to try and get a clearer picture of what is the majority viewpoint. If after this it is still not clear, the matter should be deferred or a vote may be taken if everyone is happy with this. If a vote is taken, members may either vote for or against the proposal, or members cannot make up their minds). The Chair should make sure that the proposal being voted on is stated very clearly so that everyone understands what it is.

    1. Attendance policy (2024)

Policy Aim
To enable members to attend and actively participate in all General Meetings (GM) and Annual General Meetings (AGM), as part of their membership contract with Brighton Rock Coop.
The aim of this policy is to:
• Encourage equal participation across members.
• Facilitate the smooth running of meetings.
• Follow through on assigned actions.
• Continue information sharing when any member is absent.
• Ensure members respect each other’s time as well as their own.
• Ensure the effective running of Brighton Rock Housing Cooperative and its continued existence, and to meet our obligation as Cooperative Members.
• Ensure meeting attendance is quorate in order to meet our legal obligation for voting on decisions as a recognised, liable democratic cooperative.
While the participation of all members is required for the smooth functioning of the co-op, we understand that some people will find real difficulty in attending meetings at times. If attendance at GMs/AGMs is not possible, work of a suitable nature in kind could be arranged and agreed, for example: running a sub meeting, executing actions from the missed meeting or other activities required by the Coop.

If a member is aware that they will be unable to meet these policy standards consistently, it is their responsibility to discuss this with the co-op as soon as possible. If these exceptional circumstances apply, discussions around temporary arrangements for alternative work contributions will be raised.

The spirit of the policy is to enable members to meet their obligations whilst respecting each other’s time and contributions. For this reason the dates of meetings are published a year in advance and always fall in the middle of the month to enable members to plan their attendance.

Process and member obligations

Meetings are to start promptly at the published start time. The aim is to start at 7.30 pm and finish at 9 pm.

When unable to attend any meeting (including sub meetings) written apologies should be sent to both serving secretaries with a valid reason for non-attendance.

Reasons for absence fall into the following categories which will be assigned by the group to each member not present and logged on the minutes of each meeting:

1. Away from Coop (with apologies) - meeting the apology requirements below. 2. Sickness - Unable to attend due to health issues. 3. Emergency Absence - unavailable to attend due to unexpected factors, e.g. work obligations, family issues. 4. Absent - anything outside the above categories, e.g. unreported absence (late or no communication prior to meeting), invalid reasons (prioritising alternative activities).

The “Away from Co-op” category means you are not able to attend a meeting, have given 48 hours’ notice, informed the secretary with a written apology and reason, submitted an Officer’s Report and updates on actions assigned to you. A brief Officer’s Report with any pertinent points can enable the meeting to continue in your absence. If you are designated Minute Taker or Chair please make arrangements for someone to replace you in the meeting. As mentioned above, the co-op can discuss arrangements with you to ensure equitable contributions, and keep you informed.

Sickness and Emergency Absences require notice, along with Officer’s Report and updates on actions assigned to you, where possible, bearing in mind the impact on the running of the meeting. If you are designated Minute Taker or Chair please make arrangements for someone to replace you in the meeting if possible.

Absent is a failure to meet your requirements under this policy. It will be expected that you give reasons for this at the next meeting you attend.

Reasons like “I'm away” or “I have another meeting” are not explicit and we would need more information as to why you are absent, thereby showing
respect for other members' time. If a member is going to be late for a meeting,
it is expected that they contact members of the meeting to let them know.

Those who were recorded as Absent will have the opportunity to give their reasons at the point where the minutes of the previous meeting are reviewed in the agenda.

Late arrival - If a member arrives more than 30 minutes after the publicised starting time of a meeting, without apologies, they will be recorded as Absent. It is especially important that the Minute Taker and Chair arrive on time.

Attendance Issues

Issues that would raise discussion around a members attendance would
include the following:

• Sending apologies for two consecutive meetings
• Consistent late attendance
• Frequent non attendance
• Late, inadequate or no apologies
• Not sending Officer's Reports in absence
• Non participation - i.e. lack of engagement

If a member is found not to be meeting their obligations as a member of Brighton
Rock Housing Cooperative, a letter from the secretary will be sent to that
member. Continued failure to comply will lead to the co-op initiating the grievance policy.

       10. Grievance and Mediation Policy and Procedure
           1. Introduction

This document has been composed in recognition of the inability of the existing Grievance Procedure to deal adequately with interpersonal disputes within Brighton Rock Housing Co-operative. The current procedure contains no mechanisms for the co-op to intervene other than through a full Grievance Procedure. This new procedure introduces two additional levels: the Initial Meeting and Full Mediation.
This policy does not relate to disputes between the co-op and its members in cases where members are not fulfilling their obligations under the tenancy agreement. This is the subject of another document. 2. The Incident
The incident can be either a single event or the culmination of a series of events or actions that form the basis of a dispute between two or more individual members of the co-op. The incident or events are recorded by one or more individuals on a standard complaint form available from the Secretary providing details of the nature of the dispute. This should include the names of the individuals in dispute, the nature of the events, including dates where appropriate, and any other ancillary details that might be helpful for those involved in future mediation.
On receipt of this written request for mediation, the Secretary or a member of the secretarial team, or in the absence of these post-holders, a senior member of the co-op,3 will inform all disputants in writing (incident letter) of the request for mediation and will liaise with all concerned to set up an Initial Meeting as the first step to resolution of the reported dispute. 3. Initial Meeting
A request for co-op mediation by an individual co-op member or a group of co-op members made through the submission of a complaint form and validated by the Secretary or other authorised representatives of the co-op, will result in a facilitated Initial Meeting being held between the disputants with a view to a swift and amicable resolution being agreed. Co-op members named in the incident letter are mandated to agree to participate fruitfully in an Initial Meeting. Co-op members in dispute are entitled to attend the Initial Meeting accompanied by other non-involved co-op members should they wish to be so. However, at least two wholly disinterested members of the co-op (who are found to be acceptable to all parties involved) shall attend. One shall act as a facilitator and another shall take a record of the meeting on behalf of the co-op. The Initial Meeting should be held within 2 to 3 days of disputants’ receipt of the incident letter. The facilitator’s tasks are: 1. to achieve a fair and considered airing of the issues at the heart of the dispute; 2. to ensure that disputants achieve an understanding of the position held by the other; 3. to pursue agreement on a course of action by all parties such that the issues can be resolved within a defined timeframe; 4. on reaching agreement, to establish a monitoring programme that is acceptable to all disputants to ensure compliance.
The details of each of these steps shall constitute the co-op record. Each disputant will be asked to read and sign the record before being presented with a copy.
In the event of a failure to agree, the dispute can be referred either to an Emergency General Meeting or, alternatively, act as a trigger for Full Mediation.

           4. Full Mediation

Full Mediation is the outcome of a failure to resolve the dispute through an Initial Meeting. All parties are mandated to agree to Full Mediation. Full Mediation shall normally take place not more than seven days after the recording of a failure to agree at the Initial Meeting. An external facilitator (possibly drawn from another housing co-op) shall oversee Full Mediation along with a panel of up to four members of the co-op. The aim of Full Mediation is: 1. to achieve a fair and considered airing of the issues at the heart of the dispute – initially by separate interviews; 2. to ensure that disputants achieve an understanding of the position held by each other; 3. to pursue agreement on a course of action by all parties such that the issues can be resolved within a defined timeframe; 4. on reaching agreement, to establish a monitoring programme that is acceptable to all disputants to ensure compliance.
The panel does not have the power to impose a settlement upon disputants nor to make judgements. The objective is to achieve a consensus. If consensus is not reached the dispute can be referred to the Grievance Procedure, or taken to an Emergency General Meeting at which a settlement can be imposed by majority voting.
The details of each of the above steps shall constitute the co-op record; however, disputants can ask for some details to remain confidential providing it does not prejudice the record (make it impossible to understand). Each disputant will be asked to read and sign the record before being presented with a copy. If agreement is reached and monitoring then becomes necessary, it is the responsibility of the Full Mediation Panel to agree what constitutes effective monitoring over the agreed timeframe.
Part of the Full Mediation involves agreeing the role of Sleeping Officers to be on hand to offer mediation to disputants should it be necessary. Further mediation may be part of any settlement agreed at Full Mediation. Sleeping Officers will normally have to be resident in the house in which disputants live. Any mediation will be recorded by the Sleeping Officer(s). Sleeping Officer(s) may – on the basis of persistent and fruitless additional mediation being provided – recommend that Full Mediation be abandoned and the Grievance Procedure be invoked.

           5. Grievance Procedure

The Grievance Procedure can be invoked either as a result of the failure to agree at Full Mediation, or at the request of a Emergency General Meeting called after a failure to agree at an Initial Meeting. Once it has been invoked, even in the event of a settlement having been achieved, it shall still go ahead.
5.1 The Grievance Procedure aims to do the following:
To provide a fair and equitable means of settling disputes that arise within the co-op; namely
• between the Co-op and individual members;
• between individuals; or
• between a household and an individual member.
For the purposes of this document, its relevance shall be in the context of interpersonal disputes between individuals in the Co-op. For disputes between the Co-op and individual members and between a household and an individual member, the current Grievance Procedure will remain applicable.
At all times the procedure must work in adherence to the Co-op’s Equal Opportunities Policy; namely; that decisions are just, consistent and that decisions reached are not based on discrimination resulting out of age, gender, creed, sexuality, race, etc. The Grievance Procedure must not infringe any member’s legal rights.
All members subject to the Grievance Procedure are entitled to the following expectations:
• that they will be given the opportunity to put their case with or without representation or assistance;
• that they will be heard out;
• that full consideration will be given to what they have to say;
• that in the event of the disputant(s) disagreeing with the decision of the Grievance Panel, the right exists for the matter to be reconsidered by people independent of the Co-op.
In the case of disputes between individual members of the Co-op the Grievance Procedure is invoked by the Co-op if the dispute has either failed to be resolved at an Initial Meeting or through Full Mediation, or alternatively on the recommendation of a Co-op EGM. In both cases the procedure should be administered by the Secretary or members of the Secretarial Team.
5.2 The case will normally be heard by a Grievance Panel made up of two or more officers or members of the Co-op in combination with an external facilitator. Disputants have the right to representation and/or support of other members of the Co-op or friends/associates who are not members of the Co-op.
The details of the dispute should be made available in writing to all panel members prior to the grievance meeting being held. This document is the responsibility of the Secretary or a member of the secretarial team.
When the Grievance Procedure is invoked the Secretary or a member of the Secretarial Team shall set a date that is convenient for both disputants and panel members – both internal and external to the Co-op. It should ideally be held within seven days of agreement to invoke the Grievance Procedure. All parties will be informed in writing of the date, time, venue and details of the dispute. Those involved should be informed of their rights in this respect, including that of confidentiality with regard to evidence and Panel deliberation. However, a record of both the evidence – written and verbal – and subsequent Panel deliberations (including the reasons behind decisions/recommendations and/or settlements) shall be kept. All disputants shall be referred to using false names.
Disputants should also be informed that a failure to respond, attend, or to make representations to the meeting may result in their tenancy being terminated after consideration by an EGM.
At all times, the personal safety and well-being of members shall be a primary consideration, and may justify overruling procedures laid down in this document but only if applied according to the general principles of equality and fairness also laid out in this document and only in cases involving violence, intimidation, sexual racial or other harassment, or in other cases where the Panel believes that expediency is necessary. Where personal safety is an issue, the Grievance Panel should arrange alternative accommodation at the expense of the Co-op if it is felt that it is necessary to ensure the personal safety of members involved in disputes.
The Panel shall separately and independently hear the version of the event leading up to the complaint being made from all parties involved. Written submissions will be deemed acceptable notwithstanding the points made below.
The Panel shall be empowered to question all parties involved in the dispute. Disputants have the right to respond to and question anything said about them; moreover, disputants can request to cross-question other disputants – though this may be through a facilitator rather than face-to-face. However, disputants have the right to refuse to answer questions without prejudice to their case – though disputants have a responsibility to the Co-op to participate fully in the Grievance Procedure.
The panel hearing the case has the power to adjourn proceedings in order to call in evidence regarding the dispute – either verbally or in writing – from third parties. Similarly, the panel has the power – singularly or collectively – to call for such evidence to be presented to the hearing at any time before or during the meeting.
The panel has a duty to consider external or other circumstances such as illness in its deliberations.
When all of the evidence and submissions have been presented the panel shall retire to consider the matter. In the first instance (where appropriate) the panel shall make recommendations to resolve the dispute which shall be put to the disputants for their agreement. A failure to agree may result in further panel deliberations from which a binding non-negotiable settlement shall result. However, the panel has the power to make such a settlement in the first instance if they deem it necessary. However, all decisions, recommendations and/or settlements shall be made in accordance with the principles laid out in the objectives and general principles of the Grievance Procedure detailed above under Section 5.1. When making decisions, recommendations and/or settlements, the panel shall consult the records of previous decisions, recommendations and/or settlements to ensure congruence.
In cases of violence, intimidation, sexual, racial, or other harassment, and in other similar cases, the panel shall have the power to terminate a member’s tenancy forthwith.
In any settlement the Grievance Panel will specify the monitoring programme that is to be established to ensure the settlement is adhered to. This will include both a description of monitoring activity and a timeframe.

           6. Appeal

If a disputant wishes to appeal against a Grievance Panel decision (settlement), they can do so by presenting their grounds for appeal to the Secretary. Any appeal shall be heard by a panel of at least three people external to the Co-op. The appeal shall be heard in accordance with the procedure and conditions laid out in Section 5 above.

           7. Further Action

Further action is taken on evaluation of the situation during or through the completion of the monitoring over the agreed timeframe and relates to Initial Meetings, Full Mediation and the Grievance Procedure. Examples of further action include internal transfers, assistance in finding alternative, more appropriate/supportive accommodation (for example, where appropriate mental health support is deemed necessary).

           8. Reconciliation

Reconciliation is achieved either after the successful completion of monitoring arising out of an Initial Meeting, Full Mediation or Grievance Procedure. It may also be the outcome of any Further Action.

           9. Emergency General Meeting (EGM)

An EGM may be the outcome of a failure to agree at the Initial Meeting where the issues are thought serious enough to warrant full co-op consideration. The EGM has the power to invoke the Grievance Procedure or, where the offence involves violence or a threat to the fabric of the co-op, to pursue eviction. It is understood that should eviction be the chosen option, there may be the expectation that the courts may be used if the offender does not voluntarily leave the co-op. If the EGM agrees this course of action, there is no right of appeal.
In order for this Grievance Procedure to be effective, the Co-op should construct a series of scenarios that suitably illustrate the range of issues that can be heard and the possible outcomes.
(10 May 2001 / 16 January 2002) 11. RENT PAYMENT AND ARREARS PROCEDURE
Rent is collected for payment once every 4 weeks. The dates are displayed in each house. Rent should be paid by the tenant to the designated rent officer. The rent officer will then pay rents into the bank, this is done once every 4 weeks.
The tenant can also pay their rent directly into the bank via paying in book (One in each house). Tenants should provide confirmation of payment.

At every general meeting the rent officer will inform all members of the Co-op of each tenants rent account. Where tenants are in arrears meetings will ensure that the procedure is being followed. \places for People will be kept informed of all actions regarding rent arrears above 8 weeks.

    • If a tenant has not paid their rent a letter will be sent 6 weeks after the missed rent date. (Letter 1).

    • At this stage a rent arrears agreement to pay back arrears and to pay on going rent is drawn up between the tenant and Brighton Rock Co-op. (Letter 2)

    • Any change in circumstances affecting a tenant’s ability to pay their rent or keep to their rent agreement should be notified to the rent officer immediately. The Co-op will be kept  informed at the general meeting.

The following actions will take place if the tenant fails to adhere to the above.
• At 8 weeks rent arrears NBH should be notified of the situation of any actions, rent arrears etc. NBH should be kept informed from this point on. Records of all meetings/letter relating to rent arrears should be kept, copies should be made available for NBH.

    • At 8 weeks rent arrears and no payments made a FINAL WARNING letter is sent. (Letter 3a)

    • If a tenant who has agreed a rent agreement and their rent arrears have increased to 8 weeks or more than a FINAL WARNING letter is sent. (Letter 3b)

    • One week later if no payments have been received a letter is sent notifying the tenant of the Co-op’s intention to terminate the tenancy. (Letter 4)

12. Maintenance Policy and Procedure

Maintenance Policy

    1. Emergency repairs (as defined in schedule A) will be dealt with within 24 hours subject to access.
    2. Non-urgent repairs (as defined in schedule B) will be dealt with within 28 days subject to access and subject to approval.
    3. Other repairs need the approval of a general meeting and will be subject to the limitations of financing.

Procedure

Emergency Repairs: In the first instance the tenant should contact the maintenance officer who will arrange for the work to be done. In the event that the maintenance officer is unavailable tenants may arrange for essential repairs to be carried out, where possible by an approved contractor. Following this the maintenance officer should be contacted to make a report to the general meeting. Only those repairs listed under schedule A can be considered to be the co-op’s responsibility. The tenant should exercise common sense before calling out emergency services.

Non-urgent Repairs: In the first instance the tenant should contact the maintenance officer who will make a survey (and report to a general meeting) and arrange for works to be carried out. They will arrange for three quotes from a list of approved contractors and engage the cheapest. Where quote received exceeds £40 approval of the general meeting will be required. Likewise, any doubt as to whether the works fall within the scope of schedule B works will be referred to a general meeting for approval.

Tenants Responsibility: The tenant is responsible for all repair work resulting in day to day wear and tear. This includes maintaining and replacing fuses, light bulbs, tap washers, internal decoration, minor pipe blockages, broken trip switches etc. and all damages due to tenant’s or their guests’ negligence or deliberate acts of destruction.

The tenant shall inform the co-op of all necessary repairs and will take an active role in monitoring the state of repair of the property.
The tenant will provide access for the maintenance officer and/or contractors given reasonable notice.
The tenant will inform the co-op/maintenance officer of any fault in repairs before the expiry of the contractor’s guarantee.

Where the maintenance officer is unavailable the tenant will ensure that emergency repairs are carried out (as in schedule A). The tenant is authorised, when necessary, to obtain payment form the co-op without approval of the general meeting. Any payment for emergency repairs made by the tenant will be reimbursed by the co-op on production of receipts.

The tenant shall keep all communal areas, including stairways, hallways and garden tidy and free of rubbish, and shall report any damage or dilapidation in boundary fences/wall and any damage to property from tree roots.

On giving up tenancy the tenant shall ensure the property is in good repair and decoration.

Maintenance officer’s responsibilities:

    • Ensure that the maintenance policy is adhered to
    • Keep a full written record of all repair work done
    • Collate and maintain a list of contractors approved by the co-op to carry out any repair work
    • Carry out full internal inspection s of all the properties on a bi-annual basis, as well as all properties upon termination of the tenancy
    • Organise repairs and maintenance in a prompt and careful manner.

    Sabbatical Policy

The aim of this policy is to provide the opportunity for a Coop member to be able to take a break away whilst ensuring the Coop is not adversely impacted.
A sabbatical is a fixed term break from the coop that can be taken by a housed member with the agreement of Brighton Rock members. 
The member must apply using a Sabbatical Request Form which then needs to be forwarded to the Secretary within a minimum of two GM meetings in advance of the requested sabbatical start date. 
This would then be reviewed, discussed and voted on by all coop members in the GM to approve or deny the request. 
If approved the Sabbatical Request Form  is signed and countersigned by the requesting member and current Secretary.

Questions to be discussed by coop members when considering each sabbatical request:  1. Has the applicant been actively contributing to the coop and attending meetings?  2. Is the applicant meeting the Attendance Policy?  3. Can we financially afford it as a coop?  4. Who will do their role while they are away?  5. How many sabbaticals has the member already had, and in what time frames?

Criteria to meet for applicant: 1. There must be 12 housed members at the time of the sabbatical request. Only one coop member can be on sabbatical at one time.  2. The member requesting a sabbatical must be a housed member of Brighton Rock for at least 1 year at the time of proposing the sabbatical. (See table below) 3. The member can request a sabbatical of up to 3 months in the first 2 to 3 years at Brighton Rock. (See table below) 4. A 6 month sabbatical  can be requested after the person has been a housed member for over 3 years providing they meet all other criteria. (See table below) 5. There must be a gap of at least 3 years before a member can request a second sabbatical. However, a 6 month sabbatical may be taken in two parts within a three year period. 6. A sabbatical cannot be extended after commencement of the sabbatical. 7. The applicant cannot be in rent arrears when requesting a sabbatical. 8. The applicant cannot be in house bills arrears when requesting a sabbatical. 9. Sabbaticals are agreed in order of application. If more than one person applies simultaneously the person with longest tenure takes president.

Notes
• Rent to be paid. For the agreed sabbatical period the housed member will pay a reduced rent.
This will be provided by the Treasury and Rent Teams and is the current rent charge to Places for People per person. 
At least 2/3 of the rent for the period of the sabbatical must be paid for in advance of the sabbatical period’s commencement. 
• Bills. This will be agreed within each house prior to the sabbatical request being agreed. 
The Coop suggests that the member  taking the sabbatical considers paying 1⁄4 of all fixed bills (not metered) e.g. Internet..  They do not have to pay 1⁄4 of  any other bills that are not fixed but should cover standing costs.
Household bill meter readings should be  taken upon leaving & returning. 
  This is the responsibility of the sabbatical applicant to provide on the application form. (See form below.)
• Room Access. The member’s room key should be left while on sabbatical and a house-by-house discussion should be had about whether the member’s room can be used while they are away. This would be for casual guests rather than long term use. Conditions of the use will be negotiated prior to the sabbatical’s commencement. 
• Cancellation. If the sabbatical is cancelled before commencement due to unforeseen circumstances it will not be counted again your sabbatical allowance.
If the sabbatical ends early for any reason or you need to cancel after it has commenced, the sabbatical counts as having been taken in its entirety against your allowance.
• Grievances. If a member has a grievance raised against them they must have engaged in the grievance procedure before a sabbatical can be agreed.
• Agreement. If the signed agreement is not adhered to by the member taking the sabbatical the Coop will expect the rent for the sabbatical period to be paid in full.
